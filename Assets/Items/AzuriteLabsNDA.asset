  description: Hey there, valued subject. This NDA might not sound like the ones
    you have seen before, but it holds the same value. Here at Azurite Labs, we pride
    ourselves on creating the next generation of medical technology through groundbreaking
    research at our various underwater research labs. You, as a janitor, should always
    avoid interacting with test subjects and the scientists, exclusively working
    to ensure the research station stays clean. If you see anything that you may
    have a moral objection to, keep on doing your job. You signed up for this, bucko.
    Lastly, your contract with Azurite Labs terminates at the end of this calendar
    year. Thank you for helping us work toward humanity's salvation. Thank Azul for
    what he has started.
